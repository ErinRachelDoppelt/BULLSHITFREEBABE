      <p>Whenever I travel I find myself so involved in the adventure that I forget to practice my daily spiritual habits. But it is crucial to continue these spiritual practices in order to stay grounded and connected to our authentic selves. Maintaining a spiritual practice while traveling keeps you in tune with your body’s wants and needs and provides a higher sense of intuition for safe travels.</p>
      <p>Here are some of my favorite spiritual practices:</p>
      <h2>Watch the sunrise to wipe away jet lag</h2>
      <p>This aligns your body with the time zone change.</p>
      <h2>Recite ten things you’re thankful for at sunset</h2>
      <p>Here’s an example of my ten:<br>
-My family for always supporting me<br>
-My friends for their laughter and loyalty<br>
-My ability to drop everything and see the world<br>
-Farmers’ markets with organic produce readily available<br>
-My education, formal and informal<br>
-My American passport, that allows me to travel anywhere without a visa<br>
-My good health that allows me to focus on others’ health goals<br>
-My able moving body<br>
-Record players that make Simon and Garfunkel present in my room<br>

<h2>Write down a question you have before bed</h2>
<p>The answer will come in the morning.</p>

<h2>Journal each day, everyday</h2>
<p>Buy a fun journal with a cute quote on the front that motivates you to write! Or make one on your own with this <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=DIY%20journals" target="_blank">DIY guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Eat what your body needs, not what it wants</h2>
<p>High volumes of dark leafy greens, colorful fruits and vegetables with high fat, and high protein plant-based eats are best for the traveler’s body. Follow me on<a href="https://instagram.com/bullshitfreebabe/" target="_blank"> Instagram </a>to see some of my favorite recipes and eats.</p>
<h2>Attend the local yoga classes</h2>
<p>See how other people stretch and move in the cultures you stumble upon.</p>

<h2>Look at the bulletin boards of new happenings going on for spiritual spontaneity</h2>
<p>Usually in coffee shops or on bus stops you can find flyers of the local events. While traveling in Florence, Italy I found a flyer that featured a chocolate festival! I was super happy that I found that event!</p>
<h2>Meditate each morning</h2>
<p>One of my favorite morning rituals is the half-minute-intention-setter meditation. Inhale for 10 seconds, hold for 10 seconds and exhale for 10 seconds. During this exercise recite your favorite mantras. My mantra’s are: To life, to love, to a good heart</p>
