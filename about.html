    <p> Hey Free Babes *Bowed Head* thankful to have you here!</p>
    <p>I always thought About Me’s were kinda like reading menus
    So, hopefully, you’ll wanna take a bite and ask for a side of avocado.

    <p>Erin Rachel Doppelt (often times I pronounce Rachel like Rah-KH-el, the name or KH is a gurgle in the back of the throat honors my lineage, try sounding it out!)
    I travel around the world helping people full of the BULL shift to feeling free and whole. My clients range from corporate businesses to crunchy nonprofits. I lead a retreat or immersive leadership trainings most weeks and spend the other days completing my Masters at Columbia University. Plus Plus, I spearhead a peace project for Columbia University researching international experiences and their curriculum as it relates to conflict resolution and how to create and build safe spaces to facilitate moments of meaning. </p>
    <p>I reached this point in my life after spending significant amount of time soul searching and living throughout The Middle East and South East Asia. I lived in many Ashrams and spiritual centers, met some radical people and studied up on emotional intelligence and positive psychology.</p>
    <p>I also found meditation.</p>
    <p>And if you thought drugs/sex/alcohol/relationships were fun, then darling, take a walk with me, or rather</p>
    <p>Stop</p>
    <p>Drop</p>
    <p>Sit your ass down</p>
    <p>And lets meditate</p>
    <p>Meditation helped me grow from freaked out, insecure, and overly emotional to peaceful, centered, present and calm. This shift was the greatest gift.</p>
    <p>In authentic truth, I believe I learned a skill that must be shared, especially with the rise of mental illness, and let's be real, we all have complusive (sometimes negative) thought patterns.

    <p>
       Please reach out with any questions, I'd love to share this great work with you!
